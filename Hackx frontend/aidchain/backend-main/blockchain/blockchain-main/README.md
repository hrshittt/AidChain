# Blockchain Aid Management - Main Components

## Essential Steps

### 1. Choose Blockchain Network
- Select Ethereum, Polygon, or a testnet.

### 2. Design Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- Record each donation as a blockchain transaction.
- Pool donations in a transparent fund.
- Release funds/resources automatically on delivery milestone verification.
- Log logistics and delivery events.
- Data structures for donors, transactions, milestones, confirmations.

### 3. Implement Transaction Functions
- Add donations, allocate funds, log deliveries, verify milestones, confirm receipt.

### 4. Compile & Deploy Contracts
- Use Hardhat or Truffle for testnet/mainnet deploys.

### 5. Integrate Web3 (ethers.js/web3.js)
- Backend: trigger transactions, read status, listen for events.
- Frontend: send donations, track milestones, provide explorer view.

### 6. Blockchain Explorer View
- Show on-chain transactions, milestones, confirmations with a transparency dashboard.

### 7. Testing
- Hardhat/Truffle tests, end-to-end sim, all contract flows.

### 8. Security
- Audit for vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow).
- Proper key management.

### 9. (Optional) Decentralized Storage
- Use IPFS for storing proof of delivery (images, geo-tags).
